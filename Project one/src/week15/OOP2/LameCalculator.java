/*Instructions from your teacher:

The class has methods that can do simple math operations on two numbers.

the methods are: plus, minus, multiply and divide .

all the methods get two ints then the method does the required math operation and returns the result as an int.

for example:

Output of this program should be like:

1+1 = 2
2-3 = -1
2x3 = 6
10:2 = 5*/	

}
